# Pivi_-_Plugin_For_Visual_Parallel_Programming
Pivi: An eclipse Plug-In for Visual Parallel Programming. 

The Pivi aims at providing an easier and interactive way to create a visual model of a
programming construct like if-else, while, parallel programming and other instructions. It is
primarily intended for use by students. By theoretically studying the concepts, students may find
it difficult to understand them and to implement them in a program. Another major issue is that a
lot of time and effort is needed to program a problem using legacy textural programming
languages, especially for students who are in a learning phase. Concepts of programming
constructs like if-else, while, instructions, parallel programming, concurrent programming and
multicore programming require understanding to implement them. This eclipse plug in Pivi
addresses to solve all these problems.

Solving the above-mentioned problems is important as it is easy to visualize a solution to
a problem. For beginners, it is simple and facilitates to create a visual model of a problem. Support
for visual programming helps to reduce the time that students need to invest in programming a
solution to a problem using textural programming languages and facilitates for a rapid
development. Since the tool validates the linking of icons that represent programmable constructs
and generates the code automatically, the chances of syntax errors in the code is highly reduced.
Concepts like parallel programming can solve many complex problems. By understanding such
concepts deeply, students can increase their problem-solving skills.

This Eclipse Plug-In is focused on facilitating teaching/learning techniques and
implications of parallel, concurrent and multicore programming. The developed software is an
Eclipse plugin that allows users to visually program in Java. The plugin presents a palette of icons
like if-else, instructions, connections, while, parallelization that can be used to create a program
visually. Each icon in the palette represents different constructs of a programming language. The
plugin also presents a canvas on which user can place the necessary icons from the palette to create
a program. The plugin should allow users to connect the icons present on the canvas by validating
the connections. The user will be able to modify the parameters provided for each icon. Concurrent
programming features are provided by the plugin. This includes creation of threads, execution of
instructions in multiple threads, access to the memory among threads. The plugin also validates if
the graph of icons and connections created on the canvas is a valid program. For a valid program
created visually on graph, the plugin generates the code in Java programming language which can
be understood by the user in an effective way.
